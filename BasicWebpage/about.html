      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Punjab is a culturally rich and agriculturally prosperous state in
        northern India. Its name originates from the Persian words "Panj"
        meaning five, and "Aab" meaning water, referring to the five rivers —
        Satluj, Beas, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum — that flow through the region.
      </p>

      <h2>Geography & Capital</h2>
      <p>
        The state covers an area of approximately 50,362 square kilometers and
        shares its border with Pakistan. The capital of Punjab is
        <strong>Chandigarh</strong>, which is also a union territory and the
        capital of Haryana.
      </p>

      <h2>People & Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Punjabis are known for their warm hospitality, vibrant festivals, and
        energetic music and dance forms like <strong>Bhangra</strong> and
        <strong>Giddha</strong>. The major spoken language is
        <strong>Punjabi</strong>, written in the Gurmukhi script.
      </p>

      <h2>Religion & Spirituality</h2>
      <p>
        Punjab is the birthplace of <strong>Sikhism</strong>, and is home to the
        holiest shrine in Sikhism — the <strong>Golden Temple</strong> in
        Amritsar. The state also celebrates diverse religious and cultural
        events with great enthusiasm.
      </p>

      <h2>Agriculture & Economy</h2>
      <p>
        Known as the <strong>"Granary of India"</strong>, Punjab plays a vital
        role in the country’s food grain production. Its fertile soil and
        extensive irrigation systems have made it one of India’s leading
        agricultural states.
