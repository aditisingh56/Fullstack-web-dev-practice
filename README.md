# Fullstack Web Development Practice (MERN Stack)

This repository contains hands-on practice files, mini-projects, and structured learning resources from my MERN stack fullstack web development course.

## 📚 Course Focus

The course covers all aspects of fullstack development using the MERN stack:

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database
- **Express.js** – Backend framework
- **React.js** – Frontend library
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript
- Bootstrap (in some UI examples)
- Node.js & Express.js
- React.js
- MongoDB
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `/CSS/` – Basic CSS concepts and box model practice
- `/Html/` – HTML semantic tags, forms, media, and linking
- `/my-app/` – React app setups and practice
- Other assets (images, videos) used during practice

## 🚀 Objective

This repository is a personal reference for revising and deepening my understanding of each stack component. I will progressively include:

- Projects (mini/full)
- REST API integrations
- Frontend-backend connection
- Authentication and deployment

## 📌 Status

🧠 **In Progress** — Currently learning and implementing key concepts module by module.
